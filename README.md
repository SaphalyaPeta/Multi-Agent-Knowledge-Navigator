# Multi-Agent-Knowledge-Navigator

Overview
This brings together everything from: to create a complete digital knowledge navigator. You now have natural language terminal, powerful language models, RAG-based knowledge management, and computer control. This integrates these capabilities into a unified system with a conversational interface.

Unlike previous assignments where you worked with individual components, this composes them into a cohesive system. Your terminal becomes an MCP tool, your fine-tuned models are replaced with powerful cloud models, your RAG system uses Open WebUI's built-in capabilities, and your computer control uses coordinate-based automation.

This composition approach is how modern AI systems integrate multiple capabilities. You will build a working version.

This leads to:
Integrate multiple specialized systems into a unified interface
Expose terminal functionality as MCP tools
Configure and use powerful cloud-based models
Leverage built-in RAG with advanced document parsing
Implement coordinate-based UI automation
Build a production-ready knowledge navigator

Core Components:
1. MCP Tool (Terminal)
Operations:
execute_command(cmd: str) -> output

2. Cloud Models

3. Built-in RAG:
When chatting, use the '#' sign to reference a KB.

4. MCP Tool (UI Automation)

5. Web Search
